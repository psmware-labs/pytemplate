# High Level Detail Technical Design

This template provides the high level detailed technical specifications and design to address the needs outlined during the discovery phase of the OneStrike Network Underlay Automation project and should be used as a starting point for this a detailed template.

_**If there are significant changes to requirements or design, this template should be updated accordingly and funding to support the changes should be verified and approved.**_

## 1. Project Overview

Provide high-level information to help Automnation engineers understand the what is being proposed.

## 1.1 Objective

Describe the objective of the project (2 to 3 sentences)

## 1.2 Business/Use Case (if applicable)

Provide the business/use case for the project, including the problem being solved, who/what area is impacted, and the business benefits of the project. (A few sentences will be sufficient).

## 1.3 Risks

Document specific risks that have been identified or that should be considered.

## 1.4 Out of Scope

Delineate specific activities, capabilities, and items that are out of scope for the project.

## 2. Technical Design Diagram

Provide a diagram that illustrates all new and existing technical resources required for the successful completion of this project. The diagram should include the following:

- How new infrastructure will be located and how it will connect within existing enterprise infrastructure.
- Servers, storage, network â€“ assume all are virtual unless there are specific technical issues that are expected to require physical resources.
- Logical data flow.
- Critical ancillary equipment or connections where needed.

## 3. Technical Specifications

Provide detailed technical specifications for required infrastructure as outlined below.  Delete as appropriate

### 3.1 Servers

Under the appropriate heading (3.1.1 through 3.1.4 below), list a brief description and function for each server that is needed, and include the following information:

- Operating System
- Application memory requirements
- Application CPU requirements
- Functional characteristics of the application and whether there are any system dependencies
- Expected application transaction volume

### 3.2 Switches/Routers/Loadbalancers/Firewalls

Define the access requirements

### 3.3 Access Requirements

Define the access requirements related to the following:

- Number of users requiring simultaneous access to the application
- List user communities who will need access, including
  - Developers
  - Vendors
  - Other

### 3.4 Databases

List a brief description and function for each database that is needed, and include the following information:

- Memory requirements
- CPU requirements
- Amount of storage needed the first 12 months (in GB)
- Projected annual growth (% or GB)
- Expected transaction volume
- Special data preservation requirements
- Provide technical specification data sheet for the application if available

### 3.5 Storage Needs exclusive of databases

Describe the following elements related to storage needs, excluding database requirements:

- The amount of storage needed for the first 12 months (in GB).
- Projected annual growth (% or GB).
- Data protection.

## 4. Resource Needs

Identify the staff resources needed to successfully complete this project. Also identify the staff, technical, and other resource dependencies that should be considered.

- Staff Resources
- Staff Dependencies
- Technical Dependencies
- Other Dependencies

## 5. Assumptions

Enumerate all additional assumptions that will impact the technical design, documentation and cost estimate for this project.

## 6. Concerns and Issues

Enumerate all additional concerns and issues that may impact the technical design, documentation, or cost estimate for this project.

## 7. Projected Costs

If applicable
